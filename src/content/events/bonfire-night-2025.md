title: Bonfire Night
date: "2025-11-01"
time: ''
location: "West Burton Village Green"
description: "<p>We are very grateful that Pete Wheeler has again agreed to organise the bonfire and fireworks. As ever, he would welcome any volunteers who are willing to help.</p>
<br>
<p>There is Â£1,114.71 in the dedicated account for the event, so we can look forward to an excellent display, weather permitting. Thank you to everyone who donated last year for this year's fireworks. As usual, there will be a collection on the night for next year's celebrations.</p>
<p>The practical arrangements are as follows. It is planned to lift the turf on the Green for the Bonfire over the weekend of 18 October, so that the bonfire can start to be built.</p><br>
<p>Once again Pete has asked that, if possible, large burnable items be put on the site first, followed by dry garden rubbish or other burnable items. Please do not put glass or metal or plastic on the pile for the bonfire, or anything else that could produce toxic fumes. Please also try to keep the material for the bonfire within the area of lifted turf, so as to prevent the grass on the rest of the Green being damaged.</p>
<p>The Fox and Hounds Inn will again be providing their excellent barbecued burgers and hotdogs on the night.</p>"
