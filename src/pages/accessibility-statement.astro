        <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold">Contacting us by phone or visiting us in person</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We are a very small parish council and as such we are unable to provide a text relay service for people who
          are deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Burton-cum-Walden Parish Council is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public
          Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due
          to the non-compliances listed below.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Some landmarks in some pages are incorrectly located. This may impact users who use screen readers. We are
          actively working on solutions to this and plan to have each landmark correctly located by September 2020.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information.
          This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We plan to add text alternatives for all images by 30th April 2025. When we publish new content we'll make
          sure our use of images meets accessibility standards. .
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold">PDFs and other documents</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Some of our older PDFs and Word documents do not meet accessibility standards; for example, they may not be
          structured so they're accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2
          (name, role value).New PDFs will be updated to meet Accessibility guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September
          2018 if they're not essential to providing our services.
        </p>
